# Rest API Test Framework created using Rest Assured + Jnuit + Cucumber + Maven with Allure Reporting.

The tech stack used for this framework creation are:

1. JAVA as the programming language for writing test code
2. junit as the testing framework
3. Maven as the build tool
4. IntelliJ as the preferred IDE for writing java code.

## Getting Started. Required softwares.

1. Install JDK 7 or above
2. Install IntelliJ (latest Community edition)
3. Install Maven
4. Install Git
5. Install npm for viewing allure report

## Cloning & Importing the Project

2. Install allure via terminal tab using *npm install -g allure-commandline â€”save-dev* command
3. To view the report, execute the command *allure serve target/allure-results* via terminal tab in intellij.



## Framework on High level.
This framework is developed using RestAssured for Java along with junit and using BDD approach(cucumber).

1. Converted JSON Response Body to POJO
2. Separated Test Layer with API Services
3. Implementated REST Routes
4. Shared Test Context
5. Shared Scenario Context
6. Implemented Configuration Reader
7. Tests are written in Gherkin format using feature files
8. Console logs are viewed using log4j.
9. Request and Response logs are created.
10. Result are viewed in Allure reporting with Request and Responses.
